forget about the design. im focusing on the 
functionality .
create a header to prompt user to click to gen
password . 
onclick of that function , trigger the 
passwordgenerator to function or work.
in the passwordgenerator, im going to create an
array and im going to create four variables.
the password will be 8 characters long.
so each variable will be assinged a maths.random
function . 
i will push the variables into the array . add the
join method and charley take show the user like that
on God .
after that , ago take tutorials do am proper.
